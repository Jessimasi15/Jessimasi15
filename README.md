- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jessimasi15

- 👀 I’m interested in software development, I have worked developing projects in PHP, Laravel, Java, HTML / CSS, JavaScript, 
     and I am currently developing projects in Flutter.
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning from Flutter, service connections with REST API, and I want to learn more about Java to perform REST API services with Spring Boot.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Flutter and Java projects to help me keep learning and developing amazing things. And so I can continue to grow in 
    my career as a developer.
    
- 📫 You can contact me by email jessimasi15@gmail.com
