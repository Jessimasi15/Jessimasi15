- 👋 Hi, I'm @Jessimasi15

- 👀 I'm interested in web and mobile software development. I've worked on developing projects for companies based on Java, Flutter, Dart, Angular, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, REST API, Oracle Database, Postman, Spring Boot, and I'm currently developing my own projects in Flutter and Java.

- 🌱 I'm looking to continue increasing my knowledge, and collaborate on projects and work as a team.

- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on Flutter and Java projects in which I can continue improving my skills as a software developer.
